# Quick Start — 5 Minutes to Backcoin

## Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

Add the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet to MetaMask:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Network Name | Arbitrum Sepolia |
| RPC URL | `https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc` |
| Chain ID | `421614` |
| Currency | ETH |
| Explorer | `https://sepolia.arbiscan.io` |

## Step 2: Get Test ETH

You need a small amount of Sepolia ETH for gas:

- [Arbitrum Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia)
- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

## Step 3: Visit Backcoin

Go to [backcoin.org](https://backcoin.org) and connect your wallet.

## Step 4: Claim Free BKC

Head to the **Faucet** page and claim your free BKC tokens. Each claim gives you BKC + a small ETH top-up so you can start using the platform immediately.

Faucet contract: `0xb80e5389b16693CAEe4655b535cc7Bceb4770255`

## Step 5: Add BKC to MetaMask

Import the BKC token so it shows in your wallet:

**BKC Token:** `0x1c8B7951ae769871470e9a8951d01dB39AA34123`

## Troubleshooting

**Transaction stuck?** Make sure you have enough ETH for gas. On Arbitrum Sepolia, gas is very cheap.

**BKC not showing?** Import the token address manually in MetaMask: `0x1c8B7951ae769871470e9a8951d01dB39AA34123`

**Page not loading data?** Check you're on Arbitrum Sepolia (Chain ID 421614). The app will prompt you to switch if needed.
