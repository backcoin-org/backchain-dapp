# Charity Pool — Permissionless Fundraising

Launch fundraising campaigns without middlemen. Creators receive 100% of donations (minus a small network fee). No platform cuts, no approval process, no withdrawal delays.

**Contract:** `0x31E8B7F825610aFd3d5d25C11e9C062D27289BB2`

## How It Works

### For Campaign Creators
1. **Create** a campaign with a title and description → Small ETH fee for spam prevention
2. **Share** your campaign link → Anyone can donate
3. **Close** the campaign when you're done (or leave it open indefinitely)
4. **Withdraw** all accumulated ETH to your wallet

### For Donors
1. **Browse** active campaigns
2. **Donate** any amount of ETH
3. Your donation (minus a small fee) goes directly to the campaign creator
4. No refunds, no all-or-nothing — pure donation model

## Key Principles

**No minimum goal.** Traditional crowdfunding requires hitting a target or losing everything. Charity Pool is simpler — every donation goes to the creator immediately. Whether you raise 0.01 ETH or 100 ETH, it's yours.

**No platform cut.** The contract takes a small ETH fee for the ecosystem (which feeds buyback, operators, and referrers), but there's no percentage-based platform fee on donations. Creators receive the vast majority of what's donated.

**No approval needed.** Anyone can create a campaign. There's no review process, no terms of service, no content moderation. This is a permissionless protocol — it works the same for everyone.

**Pull-based withdrawals.** Campaign creators withdraw funds on their own schedule. ETH accumulates safely in the contract until the creator is ready to claim.

## Fees

| Action | Fee Type |
|--------|---------|
| Create Campaign | Small ETH fee (spam prevention) |
| Donate | Value-based ETH fee (percentage of donation) |
| Close Campaign | Free |
| Withdraw Funds | Free |

Fees support the ecosystem: operators earn commissions, referrers earn rewards, and the remainder goes to treasury and buyback.

## Use Cases

- **Community projects** — Fund development, infrastructure, or events
- **Emergency relief** — Quick setup, immediate access to funds
- **Creative projects** — Art, music, content creation
- **Open source** — Fund public goods without gatekeepers
- **Personal causes** — Medical expenses, education, life events

## Operator Support

Both campaign creation and donations support the Operator System. Build a fundraising platform and earn commissions on every donation flowing through your interface.

Potential operator businesses:
- Regional fundraising platform (serve your local community)
- Cause-specific platform (environmental, medical, education)
- DAO treasury funding tool
- Emergency response coordination

## Transparency

Everything is on-chain:
- Total donations visible for every campaign
- Withdrawal history traceable
- Fee amounts verifiable
- No hidden costs or surprise charges

Donors can verify exactly how much went to the creator and how much went to fees, directly on the blockchain.
